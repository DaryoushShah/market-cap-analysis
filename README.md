# Market Cap Analysis
Have you ever wondered what percentage of US stocks were micro-cap, small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, or mega-cap? How about finding out what the average EPS (TTM) for each of these categories is? These are some questions that I wanted to answer from my market cap analysis.

To do this I scraped market cap and EPS (TTM) data for 8,770 publically traded US companies from Yahoo Finance.
